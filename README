README file for NYC Rent Statistics Map

This repository contains the source data and code to create the map in the file
rent_buildings.html.

To recreate the map, first run the R code in prep_data_for_map.R. This will 
produce a file called nycGP.kml, which is uploaded to this Google Fusion Table:
https://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?docid=1oDXK4PgSAusMd7buy6bPYKbzBNiXdRxAEeZfDAg.
It will also produce a file called rent.shp, which I loaded into the open source program QGIS (www.qgis.org)
to change the projection to WGS84 and convert to kml format, and uploaded to a second 
Google Fusion Table here: https://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?docid=1B7ANXGR0ITFnXMto3xI9oXx3hbVjzok-GgB51Hs.

The .html file pulls from the two Google Fusion tables using the Maps API to create the visualization.
